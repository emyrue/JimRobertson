    'Scott has been ever-present in the most supportive and trusting way at every stage of my family\'s journey. My children trust Grandpa Scott. They never question his love or feel like his love towards them is conditional. And he knows them. He has taken the time and put in the work over so many years to know not only Heather but to know my children and even to know me. I will always treasure every visit from Scott and Sherrie to all the places we have lived. I treasure the time we get to spend with him now.',

    'The thing I remember most about Uncle Scott is his patience. No matter what happened when we were around him, he always remained calm. The kindness he showed to Sherry was a testimony to me of how a marriage should be. His first concern was always for her welfare. My first desire to teach came from Uncle Scott. I saw how teaching brought such joy to him, and I wanted that in my career. I don\'t have many specific memories of Scott, only that he was just always there and always kind.',

    'I remember a number of years ago, Grandpa Thomas had all his grandsons come to rip shingles off their roof, to be redone. It was hot, and hard work. Before we began, Grandpa had explained that he would pay each of us, based on how much work we did. He kept true to that. Once the job was finished, he paid us. I remember being a little sad that I didn\'t work harder. One of the things I learned for this was about integrity. Grandpa could have easily decided to be generous to those who were younger. Or make the deviation in amounts smaller. But he didn\'t. The amounts given was equal to the work put in. Grandpa has always been an example of hard work. Even after surgeries or injuries, he would often try to do whatever needed to be done. Iâ€™ve learned the value of that kind of hard work. Thank you, Grandpa!',
