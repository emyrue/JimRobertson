    'Scott has been ever-present in the most supportive and trusting way at every stage of my family\'s journey. My children trust Grandpa Scott. They never question his love or feel like his love towards them is conditional. And he knows them. He has taken the time and put in the work over so many years to know not only Heather but to know my children and even to know me. I will always treasure every visit from Scott and Sherrie to all the places we have lived. I treasure the time we get to spend with him now.',

    'The thing I remember most about Uncle Scott is his patience. No matter what happened when we were around him, he always remained calm. The kindness he showed to Sherry was a testimony to me of how a marriage should be. His first concern was always for her welfare. My first desire to teach came from Uncle Scott. I saw how teaching brought such joy to him, and I wanted that in my career. I don\'t have many specific memories of Scott, only that he was just always there and always kind.',

    'I remember a number of years ago, Grandpa Thomas had all his grandsons come to rip shingles off their roof, to be redone. It was hot, and hard work. Before we began, Grandpa had explained that he would pay each of us, based on how much work we did. He kept true to that. Once the job was finished, he paid us. I remember being a little sad that I didn\'t work harder. One of the things I learned for this was about integrity. Grandpa could have easily decided to be generous to those who were younger. Or make the deviation in amounts smaller. But he didn\'t. The amounts given was equal to the work put in. Grandpa has always been an example of hard work. Even after surgeries or injuries, he would often try to do whatever needed to be done. I’ve learned the value of that kind of hard work. Thank you, Grandpa!',

Amongst many great events to look forward to was the morning time, since I got grandpa basically all to myself, given that grandma would usually sleep in til the afternoon. We\'d eat breakfast, watch a show, or do chores in the garden, and it was always so clear that he cared about me, even if there wasn\'t a whole lot of talking. He\'s shown me how to work hard, and what it means to contribute to your community. I love him dearly and am so grateful to be related to him.',

    'Scott, You are the essence of calm! When I was a child I remember you in the clerk\'s office. You always greeted us with a smile and hand shake. I remember going on the Green River together as families. I remember spending the night at your house and you making pancakes for us in the mornings. You always made me and my family feel like an extension of your family. We always knew we could stop at your house, uninvited and we would be welcomed in with open arms. You remembered my children\'s names and would visit with us in your easy and attentive way. We celebrated many Easters, Christmases, and Thanksgivings at your home. Brandon loved reading your history books in the basement and discussing interesting facts with you. You have always been a great example of love and patience to me and my family. We love you! Happy Birthday!!',

    'My dad likes fishing. I learned to enjoy fishing from all of the fishing trips I got to go on with him. One of our favorite fishing traditions was to hike into a lake in Yellowstone with the Woods every June. We would often catch 30 or more each. We have a lot of great memories from fishing together. The attached photo was from a trip fishing with Jason Wood and his son along with me, my boys and my dad.',
    'Another fishing story. One time at the family camping trip, we stayed at a small cabin near a private lake stocked with fish. My dad came over and helped the boys fish. I think this was the first time Gavin and Seth and maybe a few of the other boys had ever caught a fish. Here is a picture of Gavin with his first fish when he was fishing with my dad.',
