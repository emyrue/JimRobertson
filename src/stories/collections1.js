    'Grandpa Scott took me out to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the Hale Center Theater. We really enjoyed the show, and at the end, I asked Grandpa to stand behind the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang cutout and took this picture of him, which I will treasure forever. I love the time that I spend with my Grandpa. He really loves his grandkids, and you can see it in everything he does.',

    'On November 18th 2017 Brent and I got married. Scott and Sherrie came to the reception just as we were headed off in our car and I remember a van pulling up the door shot open and Sherrie saying hello to us while in her wheelchair. I will always be thankful for the effort they took to be at our wedding and I am amazed at how caring Scott is with his family particularly how sweet he was to Sherrie. Happy birthday Scott ! You\'re Brent\'s coolest great uncle ever! ðŸ˜Ž',

    'Scott was my young men\'s leader when I was a teacher. He and John Vincent planned fun activities that got us out of the house and into the mountains. One campout we got several young men to come, some of which had not been hiking or camping very much. I was impatient so Scott joined me and a few other boys at the front and Brother Vincent took the caboose to stay back with the young men who were a bit slower. \nThe hike was relatively long, but Scott knew where the lake was that we would camp by that night. A couple hours later we arrived at the lake tired, but happy that we made it. Unfortunately the slower group was not right behind us. We waited for over an hour and searched down the trail, but to no avail. Just as it was getting dark and we were starting to panic Scott suggested that we say a prayer. After the prayer we all felt more at ease. We felt impressed to set up camp for the night and that the other group would be okay. \nAfter starting a fire we ate and talked. Scott drew our attention to another fire from across the lake and said, "I\'d bet that is John and the other boys." The next morning we packed up our gear and headed down the trail only to bump right into the other boys with Brother Vincent! Scott was right that they were the group on the other side of the lake. Brother Vincent was very frustrated at us for leaving their group behind and he took out some of that frustration on me for hiking too fast. Scott "talked him off the ledge" by sharing our experience praying about what to do before setting up camp. \nI will never forget the calm assurance that Scott showed me on that trip. I have used that experience in teaching about receiving answers to personal prayers several times in my life. I am so grateful for the incredibly positive influence Scott has been to me throughout my life. Happy birthday Scott!',

    '"Good judgement comes from experience. Most experience comes from poor judgement." When I was little, Scott and I were home one night when Mom and Dad were gone somewhere. We smelled a skunk. Investigating, we found it was in the hayfield just west of the house, and southwest (upwind) of the house. So Scott decided we needed to eliminate it. He had me hold the flashlight, and he shot it with the shotgun. Since the skunk was upwind, we (and the house) were downwind. I will leave you to figure out the consequences of our successful hunt. Hence the quote at the beginning of the story.',
    'Mom\'s siblings and their families had a tradition of going to Yellowstone Park every summer, when the Yellowstone River opened to fishing, I think on the first of July. I look at that since, and knowing now that hay needed to be cut, potatoes and grain watered, and cows milked (maybe the busiest time of the year), I wonder how Dad ever found the time to go. But I remember one year Scott was left home to take care of the chores and try to keep the farmwork going by himself. I didn\'t grasp what that meant at the time, since that put a lot of the responsibility for the welfare of the family on a teenager, but I do now. What a tribute to the character of a teenage boy.',
