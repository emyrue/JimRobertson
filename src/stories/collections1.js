    'Grandpa Scott took me out to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the Hale Center Theater. We really enjoyed the show, and at the end, I asked Grandpa to stand behind the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang cutout and took this picture of him, which I will treasure forever. I love the time that I spend with my Grandpa. He really loves his grandkids, and you can see it in everything he does.',
