    'Grandpa Scott took me out to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the Hale Center Theater. We really enjoyed the show, and at the end, I asked Grandpa to stand behind the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang cutout and took this picture of him, which I will treasure forever. I love the time that I spend with my Grandpa. He really loves his grandkids, and you can see it in everything he does.',

    'On November 18th 2017 Brent and I got married. Scott and Sherrie came to the reception just as we were headed off in our car and I remember a van pulling up the door shot open and Sherrie saying hello to us while in her wheelchair. I will always be thankful for the effort they took to be at our wedding and I am amazed at how caring Scott is with his family particularly how sweet he was to Sherrie. Happy birthday Scott ! You\'re Brent\'s coolest great uncle ever! ðŸ˜Ž',
