    'While Heidi and I were dating, I had met Scott several times, of course. When I finally decided to ask Heidi to marry me, I knew I was going to have to ask Scott for his permission to marry her. I was a nervous about it, though, because I had never done something like this before. On the night I proposed to Heidi (after she said \'yes\'), we went back to their home so that I could ask him. I knew I just needed to take care of it straightaway and not put it off. So when we walked in the door to the house, I found him and directly asked him if I could talk to him privately. As I recall, Heidi and her Mom went off to another room, and Scott and I sat down to talk in the living room. It turned out to be not quite as frightening of a conversation as I had feared. Scott listened to me calmly as I nervously made my case for wanting to marry Heidi. He asked a few tough questions -- for example, wanting to make sure I had thought through how we could provide for ourselves since we were both still in school for our undergraduate degrees. And then ultimately he agreed. I appreciate the fact that Scott was so supportive during that conversation, and that he has continued to be supportive throughout my marriage to Heidi. He is kind and thoughtful, and a great example to me in so many aspects of marriage and life in general.',
