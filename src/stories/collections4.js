    'While Heidi and I were dating, I had met Scott several times, of course. When I finally decided to ask Heidi to marry me, I knew I was going to have to ask Scott for his permission to marry her. I was a nervous about it, though, because I had never done something like this before. On the night I proposed to Heidi (after she said \'yes\'), we went back to their home so that I could ask him. I knew I just needed to take care of it straightaway and not put it off. So when we walked in the door to the house, I found him and directly asked him if I could talk to him privately. As I recall, Heidi and her Mom went off to another room, and Scott and I sat down to talk in the living room. It turned out to be not quite as frightening of a conversation as I had feared. Scott listened to me calmly as I nervously made my case for wanting to marry Heidi. He asked a few tough questions -- for example, wanting to make sure I had thought through how we could provide for ourselves since we were both still in school for our undergraduate degrees. And then ultimately he agreed. I appreciate the fact that Scott was so supportive during that conversation, and that he has continued to be supportive throughout my marriage to Heidi. He is kind and thoughtful, and a great example to me in so many aspects of marriage and life in general.',

    'I feel so blessed to have Scott as a father-in-law. He has showed great love to our family and is a great example of hard work and faith. I know that his example is reflected in Jeff and each of my boys. One of my favorite memories was a time in Island Park when Gavin was 4 months old and Scott and Sherrie rented a cabin in Island Park and invited me to stay there instead of sleeping in a tent with a new born. As soon as we said our prayers and said goodnight...Scott shut off the lights and we all felt the swooping down of bats!!! Sherrie and I were screaming but Gavin slept right through the chaos....Scott, in his underwear, was standing on the railing with a broom trying to catch the bats in a pillowcase! He finally gave up because they would hide when we turned on the lights. He finally gave up and throughout the night you could feel the rush of bats flying about in the dark.... My sons have enjoyed the memories at their secret fishing hole with grandpa or anywhere with a fishing pole and a lake or stream. He is a great support to my boys and has never missed a piano recital, drum or guitar concert, play, scout award ceremony, priesthood ordination or an opportunity to share a great steak! He supported my boys as they served their missions and is always there to give a pep talk or encouraging discussion. We are so grateful for you Scott and love you very much! Love, Rosemary',
